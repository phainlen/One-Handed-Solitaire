This is a PowerShell version of One-handed solitaire. It computes stats per win, meaning it will loop until it wins and then tell you how many games it had to play until it won. You can modify the code to pause after the deck is empty if you want a more interactive experience. I decided to create this script to both challenge me and to automate the tedious adventure of shuffling and playing a game that is winnable only about 1% of the time.
